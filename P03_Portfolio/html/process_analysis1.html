            <h3>Context</h3>
              <p>This project was done during my second year at SFU for IAT235, a
                course for Information Design. As a group of 4, we were asked to
                design a microsite for the Switzerland based performing art organization
                Novel Opera Fribourg (NOF) with an expectation to combine the visual
                style of the company with Dan Friedman’s. My role in this project
                was to enhance the visual and design interaction for the homepage
                and shows page.
              </p>
              <h3>Challenge</h3>
              <p>As seen from the low fidelity wireframe in Figure 1, I started
                with a layout that we agreed on as a group. Later combined the use
                of halftone image, repetition of shapes, and decomposing typefaces
                from Friedman with NOF’s visual element at the centre of our homepage
                to bring a strong impression and unity in style. However, soon I
                discovered that the expressive typeface in the centre became a
                visual hotspot that made it hard to incorporate the home page menu
                button with a clear affordance as shown in Figure 2.
              </p>

          <div class="box-item">
            <div class="banner">

            <p>Failed to find a solution at the moment, I decided to move on to the
              next stage. After several experimentation on color combination as
              Figure 3 displays, I realized that color could become a useful indicator
              for user interaction in this case.
            </p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>In the final iteration, I ended up hiding the menu within the
              typography which will be trigger through mouse-hovering interaction
              over each line of text, so that the user navigation is playfully
              connected to the decomposed typography which will encourage users to
              explore the site. Meanwhile, I used a split complementary colour
              scheme to highlight each selected menu title as shown in Figure 4 in
              order to create visual hierarchy and variety.

      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="box-item textbox">
        <p>Furthermore, to maintain the visual and interactive consistency
          throughout site, I also applied the hovering method in the shows page
          to encourage users’ active exploration of the show list. As shown in
          Figure 5, when hovering over images it would activates a specific color
          for the halftone image icon, which is chosen according to the opera’s
          theme allowing users to get a first impression of the show.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, I am proud with my contribution to this project as I
          get to incorporate Friedman’s “unpredicatablity” in this microsite
          through playful interactive and visual elements. Most importantly, I
          learned that there is always a solution to design challenges and all
          it takes are time and exploration.
