            <h3>Context</h3>
              <p>This is another project done during my second year at SFU for IAT235 Information Design. In a group of 4, we were asked to propose a design solution for the annual event Design Indaba Festival to enhance its participant’s overall experience, with an expectation to integrate in-depth primary research. My role in this project was to research the participant’s experience and design the Info & Comment page of the interface.
              </p>
              <h3>Challenge</h3>
              <p>For the exploring stage, I started by listing down all the problem framing that we could think of. As seen from the sticky-note board in Figure 1, we narrowed it down to the direction of “Idea sharing” and “Education & knowledge” after some initial research. However, I realize that some general secondary research online was not sufficient for us to pinpoint our user’s actual pain-point. Hence, the biggest challenge for me was to gather primary resource during COVID pandemic for a festival that is taking place in India.

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Eventually, in order to get sufficient data, I reached out to over 100 people that has been to the festival on Instagram by following the tag #designindaba and browsing all the posts that has been linked with the event’s location. Although the respond rate is less that 10%, we managed to get enough data from our targeted demographics by letting them fill-up our survey questions and listed down the most helpful ones as shown in Figure 2.
            </p>
            <p>This lead to our final design focus of supporting and engaging participants during their learning experience and encourage them to share their approaches with each other through a mobile application. The feature that I designed to address this is the Info & Comment page. The actual interface design was much smoother after accurately identifying our user’s needs as shown through my process in Figure 3 from sketches to high-fidelity mock-up.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In general, I am truly glad that have done this project early in my second year as it has taught me the importance of user research and actual data in providing a truly engaging user experience, which is also crucial for developing a functional interface.
